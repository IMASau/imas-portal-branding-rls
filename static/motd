Possible issues with date and spatial search features

We are currently undergoing a software upgrade which may affect the Date and Geographic Boundary search features at Step 1 of the Portal. If you notice these search features are missing or not working correctly, please drop us an email at IMAS.DataManager@utas.edu.au.

This issue should be resolved by 11th September 2015.
